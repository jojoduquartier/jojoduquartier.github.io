Welcome to Josiah's Python Code Snippets

### About me

My name is Josiah Hounyo and I am Data Scientist with a background in Mathematics. I have a B.S. from The Ohio State University and a Professional masters from Michigan State. I love coding in general and [python](https://www.python.org/psf/) is my main go to language. This table summarizes how I rank myself in each of the programming languages I have used enough to speak about.

Language | Level
-------- | -----
Python   | Very Advanced
R        | Intermediate
Java     | Intermediate
Haskell  | Beginner (once Intermediate)

### Intent of this Site

I use Python on a daily basis for both work and personal purposes. Every once in a while I come up with reusable code that I end up using for multiple projects. Sometimes these bits of code prove useful for colleagues and friends. I have benefitted from many people sharing their code snippets online so I will use this site to pay it forward by sharing some of my code.

The site will be broken into different sections and they are described below.

#### Snippets
The snippets shared here are meant to be very simple and applicable in different situation; they are not data-science specific. If you have any suggestions or find issues with the snippets please provide information by commenting on the page; I welcome every opportunity to learn and improve.

#### Fun Projects
Here, I will provide links to select projects that I have completed and hosted on GitHub. Most of these will (very probably) be projects where I automate small tasks.

#### Python Packages
I will provide a list of python packages (as of January 2021 I only have 1).

[^1]: All these posts represent my own (personal) opinion on the topics I cover.
[^2]: Non-native python packages will be used in the snippets, if I do not provide a link to the packages, there will certainly be easy to find on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).
