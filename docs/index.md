Welcome to Josiah's Python Code Snippets

### About me

My name is Josiah Hounyo and I am Data Scientist with a background in Mathematics. I have a B.S. from The Ohio State University and a Professional masters from Michigan State. I love coding in general and [python](https://www.python.org/psf/) is my main go to language. I learned Haskell before python and although I never use Haskell, it is the programming language I love the most. 

### Project Intent

I use Python on a daily basis for both work and personal purposes. Every once in a while I come up with reusable code that I end up using for multiple projects. Sometimes these bits of code prove useful for colleagues and friends. I have benefitted from many people sharing their code snippets online so this is a way for paying it forward.

The snippets shared here are meant to be very simple and applicable in different situation; they are not data-science specific. If you have any suggestions or find issues with the snippets please provide information by commenting on the page; I welcome every opportunity to learn and improve.
